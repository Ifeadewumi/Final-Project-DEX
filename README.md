# DEXagna

Like a lasagna, this DEX has multiple layers of different tastes :
* Liquidity Providers
* Swap tokens
* Limit orders
* specific tokenomics mechanism ($LASA)
* awarded NFT for specific amount of volume traded on the platform (or reward with some $LASA)
* People can create a group and contribute a basket of money and vote to which digital asset they can buy
* Creation of ERC20 token


# Autonomous Market Maker

DEXagna will be a fork of [Solidly](https://github.com/solidlyexchange/solidly) or [Uniswap V2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core).

The aim of DEXagna is to provide a solution that meets the needs of all users:
* LP
* people who swap
* protocols who want liquidity for their token


# Frontend
At least two frontend UIs needed:
* Swap
* Liquidity Provider details (_we need to agree on what features to add here_)


# Backend


# Contracts
* Swap
* Pool
